# cl_bot
I know it is basic, but please don't use this for evil

used juliomalegria's craiglist wrapper so most credit goes to them

	run python cl.py [email] [password]
	Modify the craigslistforsale function to change the area it looks and the specifics of what you are looking for
	change the get results function to change how many are pulled and how they are sorted


Just go to the github mentioned earlier to see how any of the craigslist functions work
